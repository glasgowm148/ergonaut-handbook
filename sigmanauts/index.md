Sigmanauts gain exclusive access to the team, bringing ideas to the wider community and representing them while helping to shape Ergo going forward whether it be in any of your contributions in writing, campaigning, or shaping of the sigmanauts structure or Ergo itself. 

The Sigmannaut  Program is structured in the following format:
### Growth
