# Nodes
A node is simply a computer that connects to a cryptocurrencyâ€™s blockchain network. It can be used to process transactions, store data about those transactions, and keep track of other nodes on the network. Nodes are essential to supporting the cryptocurrency network, and without them, the system would not be able to function.

## Set-up and Configuring an Ergo Node
The article "[How to set up and configure a full Ergo node](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_02_how_to_setup/)" provides the essential information. You could also try this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpEDJ1CM6ns) on installing a node or use the directions in the offical [Ergo documentation](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/node/install/). If you run into trouble, ask in the nodes channel in the Ergo Discord.
