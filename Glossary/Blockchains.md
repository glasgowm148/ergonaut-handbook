# Blockchains

A blockchain is a type of database or ledger that is duplicated and distributed to all participants within the blockchain network. 

If cryptocurrency is comparable to digital money, then blockchain is the network on which the digital money operates. 

The first working blockchain is known as Bitcoin, and *many* blockchains have been created since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009.
