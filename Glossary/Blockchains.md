A blockchain is a type of database or ledger that is duplicated and distributed to all participants within the blockchain network.

The first working blockchain is known as Bitcoin, and *many* blockchains have been created since Bitcoin's introduction in 2009.

The word *blockchain* describes how it works: to earn block rewards and transaction fees, indiviual nodes compete in a race to be the block leader using a consensus mechanism (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof of Authority, Proof of Time, etc.) 
- The node which is chosen as block leader collects recent, unconfirmed transactions from mempool and includes them in the new block. Each new block points to the hash of the block before it, these blocks form a chain of blocks, or a **blockchain**.
