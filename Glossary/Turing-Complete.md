# Turing-complete
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#):

In colloquial usage, the terms "Turing-complete" and "Turing-equivalent" are used to mean that any real-world general-purpose computer or computer language can approximately simulate the computational aspects of any other real-world general-purpose computer or computer language.
