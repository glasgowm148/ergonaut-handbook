# Turing-complete
## Description

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#):

- In colloquial usage, the terms "Turing-complete" and "Turing-equivalent" are used to mean that any real-world general-purpose computer or computer language can approximately simulate the computational aspects of any other real-world general-purpose computer or computer language.

- The Church–Turing thesis states that this is a law of mathematics – that a universal Turing machine can, *in principle*, perform any calculation that any other programmable computer can. This says nothing about the effort needed to write the program, or the time it may take for the machine to perform the calculation, or any abilities the machine may possess that have nothing to do with computation.

- Ethereum advocated the execution of a Turing-complete language on the blockchain. It *theoretically* promised unlimited potential; however, in practice, severe limitations came to light from excessive blockchain bloat, subtle multi-million dollar bugs, gas costs that limit contract complexity, and other such problems. 

- Ergo on the flip side, extends UTXO to enable Turing-completeness while limiting the complexity of the [ErgoScript](https://ergonaut.space/en/Glossary/ErgoScript) language itself. **The same expressive power is achieved in a different and more semantically sound way.**
