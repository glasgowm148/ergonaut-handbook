# Atomic Swaps

> An atomic swap is a method of securely exchanging tokens across distinct blockchains, without an intermediary.The code for an atomic swap requires that either transactions on both chains take place, or neither do; the transactions are executed simultaneously. Decred and Litecoin completed the first mainnet atomic swap in 2017.
