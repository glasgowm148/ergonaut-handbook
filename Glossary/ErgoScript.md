# ErgoScript
ErgoScript is a powerful and protocol-friendly scripting language for cryptocurrencies. Programs in ErgoScript are used to specify the conditions under which currency can be spent. The language supports a type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs called [Sigma (Î£) protocols](https://ergonaut.space/en/Glossary/sigma-protocols) and is flexible enough to allow for: ring-signatures, multi signatures, multiple currencies, [atomic swaps](/en/Glossary/Atomic-Swaps), self-replicating scripts, and long-term computation.
