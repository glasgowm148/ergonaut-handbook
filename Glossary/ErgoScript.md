# ErgoScript
ErgoScript is a powerful and protocol-friendly scripting language for cryptocurrencies. Programs in ErgoScript are used to specify the conditions under which currency can be spent. The language supports a type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs called [Sigma (Î£) protocols](https://ergonaut.space/en/Glossary/sigma-protocols) and is flexible enough to allow for: ring-signatures, multi signatures, multiple currencies, [atomic swaps](/en/Glossary/Atomic-Swaps), self-replicating scripts, and long-term computation.

**ErgoScript is a super-simple subset of Scala.** It is a top-level language translated into a low-level language called ErgoTree, which is translated during execution into cryptographic protocol. 

Ergo's support for sigma-protocols (aka generalized Schnorr proofs) is truly unique. As building bricks for composable statements, Ergo supports Schnorr protocols and proof-of-Diffie-Hellman-tuples, but more can be added via soft-forks


## Key Concepts

- Ergo is considered an *extended-UTXO model*, supporting advanced financial contracts similar to those in Ethereum's account-based model
- Since Ergo is UTXO based, therefore ErgoScript has many UTXO-specific constructs such as: 
  - `Box`, `INPUTS`, `OUTPUTS`
  - A complete list is available [here](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/docs/LangSpec.md)
- A `Box` is essentially a UTXO and consists of up to ten registers for storing data. Similar to Bitcoin, a transaction spends one or more existing boxes (denoted using the `INPUTS` array), and creates one or more new boxes (denoted using the `OUTPUTS` array)
- ErgoScript's syntax is a subset of Scala's. However, knowledge of Scala is not necessary to learn ErgoScript because the amount of Scala needed to write ErgoScript is small e.g. `val`
- Note that arrays in Scala are accessed using round parentheses, not square brackets like in Java or Python. Thus, `OUTPUTS(0)` refers to the first element of the `OUTPUTS` array
- Unlike Scala, ErgoScript does not support the `var` keyword, and thus everything is immutable
- The scripting language in itself is non-Turing complete, but applications can be made to be Turing complete as demonstrated in [this peer-reviewed paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10116v1.pdf).
