Decentralized Exchanges or *DEXes* - allow peer to peer trading without a central authority. The stablecoin [SigmaUSD](/SigmaUSD) (instantiation of AgeUSD) is technically also a decentralised exchange, however [Spectrum](/en/dApps/ergodex) (formerly ErgoDex) is closer to what most people recognise as a decentralised exchange today.

Additionally, integration with [Gravity/Waves](gravity) is nearing completion, and a *Trustless*  Local Exchange Trading System or [LETS](/dex/Local-Exchange-Trading-System) (a local mutual credit association in which individual members are allowed to create/ spend the group's unique "currency" on items and services) is also possible on top Ergo.
