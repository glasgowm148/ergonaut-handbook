# Needed Directory & Pages 
* A meta directory related to The Ergonaut Handbook itself (done with the creation of this page)
* A link to a github repo for The Ergonaut Handbook software, if there is one

# Bugs in The Ergonaut Handbook
I'm not sure if there is a github repo, so this is a placeholder for issues related to the software The Ergonaut Handbook runs on.

* Posted comments, but these do not appear in the Activity Statistics of the user's Profile page
*  Comments cannot be deleted (at least from my end) maybe Admin can delete them? 

Please see [docs.requarks.io](https://docs.requarks.io/) for the documentation for this site.
