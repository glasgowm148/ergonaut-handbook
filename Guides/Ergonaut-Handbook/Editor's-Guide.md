ergonaut.space is a community-driven site set up to help consolidate the vast wealth of information that is fragmented around the web. The site is backed up on [Github](https://github.com/glasgowm148/ergonaut-handbook) automatically on a regular basis to prevent data-loss/vandalism.

# Editor's Guide

The site is written in Markdown, which is trivial to pick up (you might've already used it before without realising), but there is a fully fleshed visual editor which makes it even simpler. 

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and this web-based [live preview tool](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) may come in handy when creating and editing content for The Ergonaut Handbook.


# Regional versions

The platform supports several regional languages.
