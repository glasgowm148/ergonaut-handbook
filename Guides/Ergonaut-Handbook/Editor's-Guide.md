ergonaut.space is a community-driven site set up to help consolidate the vast wealth of information that is fragmented around the web. The site is backed up on [Github](https://github.com/glasgowm148/ergonaut-handbook) automatically on a regular basis to prevent data-loss/vandalism.

# Editor's Guide

The site is written in Markdown, which is trivial to pick up (you might've already used it before without realising), but there is also a fully-fleshed visual editor which makes it even simpler. 

- [Markdown Cheat-Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) | Includes syntax of both Basic and Extended Markdown
- [Web-based live Markdown preview tool](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) | May come in handy when creating and editing offline content for The Ergonaut Handbook. 

Like mentioned above, there is a built-in visual editor which can side-step the need to format wiki content in Markdown, if you prefer.  However, you may personally find it beneficial to pre-format content in Markdown and then simply upload it to the Ergonaut Handbook. 

# Regional versions

The platform supports several regional languages. The above information/tools should help anyone interested in adding a new regional language to the site.
