# Earning Yield on Ergo

Ergo is a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, which means it doesn't support staking like Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains. However, you can still earn yield on your ERG holdings by participating in liquidity pools, dApp tokenization, trading bots, lending platforms, and other innovative mechanisms.

To maximize yield opportunities on Ergo, individuals and entities can leverage various strategies and platforms within the Ergo ecosystem, catering to different risk tolerances, market views, and financial goals. Here are a few hypothetical personas and how they might use Ergo and its DApps to execute their strategies:

### 1. The Conservative Lender
- **Persona:** Prefers low-risk investments and is interested in earning steady, passive income without significant exposure to market volatility.
- **Strategy:** Uses lending platforms like **Duckpools** to provide liquidity in the form of ERG or stablecoins. This individual can lend ERG to earn interest over time, benefiting from the security of collateralized loans.

### 2. The Speculative Trader
- **Persona:** Enjoys high-risk, high-reward opportunities. They are skilled in technical analysis and market timing, seeking to capitalize on price fluctuations.
- **Strategy:** Engages in options trading on **SigmaO** and participates in liquidity pools on **Spectrum** for assets with high volatility. They might also use grid trading bots available through **Machina Finance** or **Off-the-grid** for automated trading strategies.

### 3. The DeFi Enthusiast
- **Persona:** A firm believer in decentralized finance, looking to explore innovative financial instruments and yield farming opportunities. They are willing to take on moderate risks for higher returns.
- **Strategy:** Participates in DegFi projects like **Hodlcoin** or **Auction Coin** for potential high rewards. They might also farm tokens on **Spectrum Finance** by providing liquidity to selected pools, taking advantage of the platform's farming incentives.

### 4. The Passive Income Seeker
- **Persona:** Interested in generating passive income without daily market engagement. They prefer strategies that offer steady returns over time.
- **Strategy:** Could stake ERG on platforms like **ErgoPad** or **Auction House** to earn rewards. They might also become a watcher on the Rosen network, earning fees by assisting in the operation of cross-chain bridges.

### 5. The Market Maker
- **Persona:** Looks to profit from providing liquidity and creating efficient markets. They have a significant amount of capital and are interested in earning through spread and fees.
- **Strategy:** Acts as a market maker on low-liquidity exchanges like **SevenSeas** and **TradeOgre**. They could also deploy custom trading bots on platforms like **shrimpy.io** or **3commas** to automate their trading strategies across various exchanges.


### 6. The Ecosystem Validator

- **Persona:** This role is for individuals with a keen interest in supporting and validating the Ergo ecosystem's operations. They seek to contribute to the network's security, efficiency, and reliability, aligning with the broader goals of decentralized finance and blockchain technology. While they may not be developers, they possess the technical acumen and willingness to engage deeply with the Ergo ecosystem's mechanisms.

- **Strategy:** 
  - **Oracle Contribution**: Participants can operate a GORT (Gold Oracle Reward Tokens) oracle, playing a crucial role in providing accurate and reliable price feeds for DeFi applications within the Ergo ecosystem. This task, essential for the ecosystem's health, rewards operators with GORT tokens, allowing for an impactful contribution without the need for advanced development skills.
  
  - **Rosen Bridge Monitoring**: As a Rosen Watcher, individuals oversee and validate the transactions facilitated by the Rosen bridge, which connects Ergo with other blockchain ecosystems like Cardano. This role is vital for ensuring the bridge operates securely and efficiently, with watchers being rewarded in ERG and other involved tokens. It represents a unique opportunity to support cross-chain interoperability and earn rewards for maintaining critical infrastructure components.

### 7. The Ethical Investor
- **Persona:** Prefers to invest in projects that align with their personal values, such as decentralization, privacy, and community governance.
- **Strategy:** Looks for opportunities to participate in governance tokens or invests in projects with a strong community backing. They might also seek out NFT marketplaces within the Ergo ecosystem to support digital artists and creators directly.

Each of these personas can find suitable yield-generating opportunities within the Ergo ecosystem, leveraging its diverse range of DApps and financial instruments to align with their individual goals and risk tolerance.

## Yield Analytics

### Rosen Watcher Rewards

The following data represents an example of the reward distribution for a single watcher on the Rosen network within the period from January 22, 2024, to February 3, 2024. The actual rewards can vary based on the traffic on the bridge.

- ERG Watcher Rewards:  100.217 ERG
- ADA Watcher Rewards:  25.37 ADA
- Total Rewards (ERG + ADA):  125.59

Please note that these figures are subject to change and depend on the actual bridge traffic. The more traffic the bridge has, the higher the potential rewards for the watcher.

For more information on becoming a watcher, please see [this page](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/eco/rosen/rosen-watcher/)

### Duckpools

Some early analytics pulled up by Luivatra shows a [8% return in ~5 months](https://twitter.com/Luivatra/status/1750497386856665115) on SigUSD deposited in duckpools. 

### GORT

Operating an oracle within the Ergo ecosystem offers a unique opportunity to earn approximately 24 GORT (Gold Oracle Reward Tokens) per day as rewards. These tokens serve as a testament to your contribution to the network and can be a source of passive income.

To join the existing oracle pool, you will need Gold Pool Oracle Tokens. These tokens are periodically made available through [auctions](https://ergoauctions.org/artwork/78263e5613557e129f075f0a241287e09c4204be76ad53d77d6e7feebcccb001), providing a fair and transparent process for potential participants.

But why should you consider owning GORT? Here are a few compelling reasons:

- **Support the Ergo Gold Cooperative:** By owning GORT, you are directly supporting the gold price feed for the Ergo Gold Cooperative. This is a crucial component of the ecosystem, and your contribution helps ensure its accuracy and reliability.
- **Earn Passive Income:** The GORT you earn from running an oracle can be a source of passive income. As the network grows and the value of GORT increases, this income can potentially become a significant part of your earnings.
- **Provide ERG/GORT Liquidity:** Owning GORT also allows you to provide liquidity to the ERG/GORT pair. This not only helps stabilize the market but also earns you additional income from transaction fees.
# Centralized Exchange Offerings

In the context of our project, which was launched with fairness at its core, there isn't a single entity or individual that holds a significant portion of the total supply. This means that we don't have the option to rely on a single market-maker to ensure liquidity in the market. However, this doesn't pose a barrier to achieving a truly liquid market. In fact, it opens up the opportunity for a more decentralized and robust liquidity provision. By encouraging a large number of participants to contribute smaller amounts, we can collectively create a market that is not only liquid but also more resilient and less susceptible to manipulation. This approach aligns with our commitment to decentralization and community participation.

There is currently one decentralized exchange on Ergo, [Spectrum](https://app.spectrum.fi/). There are several pools on Spectrum with a visible estimated asset annual percentage yield (APY) that can be used for yield harvesting.

Your redeemable amount changes as the pool gets used and a percentage of the swaps are earned by the pool. You get a percent of the pool fee proportional to your stake.

- SigRSV/ERG pair
	-	Minimises impermanent loss (both coins move in the same direction price-wise)
- SigUSD/ERG
	- High IL risk, however a solid investment if you want to earn fee's off your nest-egg. SigUSD has has never came close to loosing it's peg.

## Automated Market Makers (AMMs)

An Automated Market Maker (AMM) uses mathematical models to set the price and match buyers and sellers rather than merely matching buy and sell orders, as in traditional order-books. AMM is best in markets with low liquidity. 

One of the features of AMM is that liquidity providers add assets to the exchange for a fee, and the market benefits from an increase in liquidity, smaller latency, limited price slippage, and less market volatility when using this additional liquidity.

Please be aware of [impermanent loss](https://ergonaut.space/en/Guides/yield#impermanent-loss-volitality-harvesting).


## Impermanent Loss / Volitality Harvesting

Impermanent loss (IL) occurs when the mathematical formula of an AMM adjusts the asset ratio in a pool to ensure both assets remain at an even value. 

Example: You enter an AMM pool of Erg/SigUSD, when the prices of each of these assets is at $10 and $1. So, you put in 1 Erg for every $10 SigUSD into the pool. 

Then, Erg's price goes to $20 a month later. Let's assume you earned $2 in fees. You'll then have 0.8 Erg and $16 SigUSD to have even amounts in the pool, or $32. The higher the price of Erg relative to SigUSD, the less Erg you have.

So, why would anyone provide liquidity to an AMM in an asset they expected to go up and a stablecoin like SigUSD? The answer: volitality harvesting.

There's an [involved paper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/uniswaps-alchemy), but here's the central idea: digital assets like Erg don't just increase. They have a lot of volitality, ups and downs, and if you are in an AMM liquidity pool, the balancing of the AMM of the pool works as a kind of dollar cost averaging. It buys more of the asset that costs less when it is down and less of the asset that costs more when it is up.
