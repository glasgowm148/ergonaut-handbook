# Earning Yield on Ergo

Ergo is a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, which means it doesn't support staking like Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains. However, you can still earn yield on your ERG holdings by participating in liquidity pools, dApp tokenization, trading bots, lending platforms, and other innovative mechanisms.

You can 'stake' native tokens on Ergo through platforms like ergopad.io (live), Night Owl Casino (coming soon), ErgoMixer (coming soon), and more. One such method is the Profit-Sharing dApp, which allows token holders to earn a share of a dApp's revenue.

There is currently one decentralized exchange on Ergo, [Spectrum](https://app.spectrum.fi/). There are several pools on Spectrum with a visible estimated asset annual percentage yield (APY) that can be used for yield harvesting.

Your redeemable amount changes as the pool gets used and a percentage of the swaps are earned by the pool. You get a percent of the pool fee proportional to your stake.

- SigRSV/ERG pair
	-	Minimises impermanent loss (both coins move in the same direction price-wise)
- SigUSD/ERG
	- High IL risk, however a solid investment if you want to earn fee's off your nest-egg. SigUSD has has never came close to loosing it's peg.

# More


In addition to the previously mentioned methods, you can explore other opportunities to generate yield with your Ergo holdings. Check out the [Blog: Earning ERG in 2023 and Beyond](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/Earning-ERG-in-2023-and-Beyond/) and here are a few more options:

### NFT Marketplace

As the NFT space continues to grow, consider investing in Ergo-based NFTs as a way to potentially generate returns. Look out for emerging NFT marketplaces on the Ergo platform where you can buy, sell, and trade digital art and collectibles.

### Governance Tokens

Some Ergo-based projects may issue governance tokens, allowing holders to participate in the decision-making process for platform development. By staking or voting with these tokens, you could potentially earn rewards or gain access to exclusive features and benefits.

### Arbitrage Opportunities

Monitor various exchanges and DeFi platforms for price discrepancies in ERG and other tokens. Exploit these arbitrage opportunities to generate profits from the price differences. Be mindful of transaction fees and potential risks when employing this strategy.

### Airdrops

Stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the Ergo ecosystem, as new projects may offer airdrops to ERG holders or early adopters. By participating in these airdrops, you can receive free tokens, which could increase in value over time.

### Token Sales

Participate in Initial Decentralized Token Offerings (IDOs) on platforms like ErgoPad. By investing early in promising projects, you can potentially benefit from the growth in value of these tokens.

Remember, each investment opportunity carries its own risks, and it's essential to conduct thorough research before participating. Stay informed about the latest news and updates in the Ergo ecosystem to make well-informed decisions and maximize your potential returns.



# Appendix


## [Ergo Profit-Sharing DApp](https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoProfitSharingDapp)

This innovative service enables dApps to distribute earnings among their token holders. Initial implementations will tokenize ErgoMixer, followed by Ergo Auction House and Ergo Raffle. ErgoMixer's revenue, currently received by its creator, will be distributed to $MIX token holders who stake their tokens in the Profit Sharing contract.


So, it will not be way a way to 'stake' ERG at first. However in the future it could be used in some creative services to provide ERG-staking.

## Automated Market Makers (AMMs)

An Automated Market Maker (AMM) uses mathematical models to set the price and match buyers and sellers rather than merely matching buy and sell orders, as in traditional order-books. AMM is best in markets with low liquidity. 

One of the features of AMM is that liquidity providers add assets to the exchange for a fee, and the market benefits from an increase in liquidity, smaller latency, limited price slippage, and less market volatility when using this additional liquidity.

Please be aware of [impermanent loss](https://ergonaut.space/en/Guides/yield#impermanent-loss-volitality-harvesting).


## Impermanent Loss / Volitality Harvesting

Impermanent loss (IL) occurs when the mathematical formula of an AMM adjusts the asset ratio in a pool to ensure both assets remain at an even value. 

Example: You enter an AMM pool of Erg/SigUSD, when the prices of each of these assets is at $10 and $1. So, you put in 1 Erg for every $10 SigUSD into the pool. 

Then, Erg's price goes to $20 a month later. Let's assume you earned $2 in fees. You'll then have 0.8 Erg and $16 SigUSD to have even amounts in the pool, or $32. The higher the price of Erg relative to SigUSD, the less Erg you have.

So, why would anyone provide liquidity to an AMM in an asset they expected to go up and a stablecoin like SigUSD? The answer: volitality harvesting.

There's an [involved paper](https://research.paradigm.xyz/uniswaps-alchemy), but here's the central idea: digital assets like Erg don't just increase. They have a lot of volitality, ups and downs, and if you are in an AMM liquidity pool, the balancing of the AMM of the pool works as a kind of dollar cost averaging. It buys more of the asset that costs less when it is down and less of the asset that costs more when it is up.
