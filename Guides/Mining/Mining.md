> There are active miner communities for Ergo on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q86PNMwRsu) and [Telegram](https://t.me/ergo_mining)

## The Coin: What is Ergo?

Ergo has a strictly limited supply, an 8‐year emission schedule and a declining rate of emission over these 8 years. All tokens are mined through an original Proof‐of‐Work (“PoW”) algorithm called [Autolykos](https://ergonaut.space/en/Autolykos), which employs a [smoothed difficulty algorithm](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/ErgoPow.pdf)

There was 0 ERG in existence at launch of mainnet as there was no ICO nor pre‐mine. At the end of 8 years, the final Erg supply will be 97,739,925 Ergs. The Ergo block interval is 2 minutes and for the first 2 years, each block will release a total of 75 Ergs to be shared between the miners and the Treasury (Treasury discussed below). But starting at year 2, the rate of emission will fall by 3.0 Ergs and thereafter further decline every 3 months by an additional 3.0 Ergs, which will result in an end to emission 8 years after launch. 

- [Ergo Emission: details, retargeting via a soft-fork](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/ergo-emission-details-retargeting-via-a-soft-fork/2778)

There will be no additional inflation and the Erg monetary base will remain fixed. The [emission schedule chart](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/) illustrates this which can also be found on [ergo.watch](https://ergo.watch/emission).

-   [Ergo Whitepapers](https://ergoplatform.org/en/documents/)

## The Wallet:

A wallet will be required for you to collect your mining rewards. Digital wallets can help keep your digital currency safe, private and in your control. We highly recommend the use of wallets for storing Ergo assets (technically, they store the keys to your Ergo addresses). But keep in mind, your wallet is unlike your bank account, so take extra precautions with your passwords and be sure to perform regular backups to protect your money.

### Wallet Types:

[Third Party Wallets](https://ergoplatform.org/en/wallets/)

[Ergo Node Wallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node)

> Note that most wallets are supported by third parties, we only provide the information as a courtesy, in order to simplify the overall digital currency experience for you.
{.is-warning}


> Please don't mine direct to exchanges as this allows them to control price movement. Support decentralization.
{.is-danger}


## The Hardware:

You will need computer hardware to mine Ergo also refered to as a mining rig. Ergo mining is ASIC resistant and requires a GPU (Graphics Card) for mining. A mining rig can be as simple as a single GPU gaming computer, up to a multi GPU mining rig.

While it is possible to mine Ergo with a 4gb GPU. A 6GB GPU is the suggested minimum as Ergo heavily relies on memory usage while the core processor sits idle.

### Components required to build a mining rig:

-   [Graphics Card (GPU)](https://ergonaut.space/en/Guides/Mining/Graphics_Cards)
-   [Motherboard (MOBO)](https://ergonaut.space/en/Motherboards)
-   Power Supply (PSU)
-   Processor (CPU)
-   Memory (RAM)
-   Storage (USB, SSD, HDD)
-   Other Hardware
    -   GPU Risers
    -   CPU Cooler
    -   Mining Rack
    -   Fans

Search your card here [Autolykos v2 hashrates](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/autolykos-v2-hashrates/580) to find the hashrate.

Check pool stats to see ranking of pools. See note regarding 51% attack below

-   [Mining Pool Stats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/ergo)

> Please do not mine to mining pools with large hashrate. Any pool close to 51% of the total network is at risk of an attack.

## The Miners: (Mining Software)
There are multiple miners that can be used to mine Ergo (Autolykos2).  Below you will find a list of mining software that can be used to mine ERG.  There are various opinions as to which mining software is best and some are clear winners.  Best advice is to try them all if you can and see what works best for your rig set up specifically.   What works for one may or may not work for another

In addition to dedicated mining software, there are also Mining OS or operating systems such as Hive which is one of the more popular ones.  This allows you to control your rig through dedicated software that will assist with connecting to pools, OC settings, and miners or mining software. These would be considered an all in one package where as using a specific miner may require other resources or plug ins.

# Solo Mining

[Can I solo mine?](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBFv3mxpu5Erv55zvfFuIo2NnaWht3cc70xZoRo-3c58Cv0A/viewform)

- [Autolykos2_AMD_Miner](https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_AMD_Miner)

In order to used them, you may or may not need to use: Stratum Server and Stratum Proxy. These two projects are here:

- [ErgoStratumServer](https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumServer)
- [ErgoStratumProxy](https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumProxy)

# Difficulty 

Ergo uses the linear least square method which smoothes over 8 epochs (8 x 1024 blocks). This was designed to prevent malicious time warp and coin-hopping attacks.

The [difficulty over time](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/charts/difficulty) is visible here. If you want an estimate of what might be next you can observe the [Difficulty and epoch monitor.](http://cds.oette.info/ergo_diff.htm)

# Host A Pool

Currently the [#host-a-pool](https://discord.gg/kxbrHVwnm5) on Discord is the best place to get support configuring a pool. 

- [ErgoStratumProxy](https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumProxy) | Miner Connection + Work Management
- [ErgoStratumServer](https://github.com/mhssamadani/ErgoStratumServer) |  Pool Server
- [ergo-nomp](https://github.com/btclinux/ergo-nomp) | Node open mining portal configufed for ergo

**Step by Step**

1. Setup a Node
2. Setup ErgoStratumServer
3. Point [ergo-nomp](https://github.com/btclinux/ergo-nomp) to (1) and (2).
