# ERGO Guerrilla Marketing Toolkit

The Ergo community might not be as big as Bitcoin’s, Ethereum’s or Cardano’s communities, but it is fiercer and more passionate. We are taking marketing into our own hands; we have created a resource to provide tactics and tools for the community to effectively bring Ergo to the masses. If you are unfamiliar with guerrilla marketing, we will publish a few articles at the end of this post. These are the actions you can take as individuals or groups for Ergo. We have divided them into 4 categories:

## Supporters

These are Ergo supporters and users who want to help bring more awareness to Ergo, but might not have the time, following, or interest in being an activist or ambassador of Ergo.

1. Write posts on forums, social media, or comments on news sites who post crypto-related content that does not mention Ergo. A great example of this are Ergo’s own Armeanio’s posts on Medium, a free platform for writers, where he updates the community on a weekly basis about changes around Ergo and developer updates: [https://curiaregiscrypto.medium.com/](https://curiaregiscrypto.medium.com/). Another example are /u/sgtpepe infographics on non-Ergo subreddits like [https://reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/o7sk9e/ergo\_cardano\_the\_future\_of\_defi/](https://old.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/o7sk9e/ergo_cardano_the_future_of_defi/).

Get creative, though, because there are many other audiences outside of cryptocurrency, finance, and technology that might be interested in Ergo as a platform for their projects. For example, NFTs are perfect to be marketed towards artists and content creators. You can probably think of ways of marketing Ergo to other communities as well!

2.	Share resources and news about Ergo with friends who are interested in cryptocurrencies. Educate those you know about real projects, and how they differ from popular dog tokens and Bitcoin.

3.	Create or contribute on podcasts, videos on Youtube/twitch, websites, etc. The more content the better!

4.	Leave comments on Youtube, Twitch, Tik Tok, and other platforms referring people to Ergo. You can link them to infographics from the community, or to videos on Youtube that explain the advantages of Ergo over other cryptocurrencies.

5.	Write an op-ed to your local newspaper talking about Ergo and how it is revolutionizing the Crypto space with its choice of privacy dApps like ErgoMixer, its affordable and easy to use NFT auction houses, and its powerful tools like Oracle Pools.

6.	Reach to local businesses you frequent and ask if they are interested in accepting crypto as a form of payment and recommend Ergo as a good option for quick and affordable transactions. 7.

## Activists

1. Social Media Activism. Try to “highjack” hashtags on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook with posts about Ergo’s news, Ergo’s dApps, NFTs, and more. Comment on Youtube videos, Reddit posts, and anywhere else outside the Ergo ecosystem. 
2. Public Venues. Using public venues has been an effective marketing tactic for projects like Bitcoin and Monero. Consider sticking Ergo stickers on concerts, fairs, major conferences, political events, etc. Might even bring an Ergo flag with you if you have one!
3. Competitive Venues. Using guerrilla marketing tactics at venues that compete against Ergo is considered a riskier approach but can have a big social impact. Think: financial institutions like banks, investment banks, predatory loan companies, etc.
4. Projection. With an image, a small laptop, and an affordable projector you can make a huge impact. Consider projecting the Ergo Logo in a building, a concert, or a public event.
5. Information Drop. Mass print pamphlets about Ergo in public events, talk to people about why Ergo is such a great project to support, and how the freedom to choose how private your data should be is real financial freedom.
6. QR Codes. Mass print QR codes to attract attention in public spaces.
7. Stamping. Stamping physical fiat currencies like the US Dollar or the Euro is legal and efficient. Each dollar bill is seen by 438 people on average.

## Funders

Funders support the community by funding ideas, content, and more. There are projects being developed to collect funds from the community to support projects, content creators, ads, and more.

## Designers

Designers are a crucial part of the Ergo community. They give the rest of the community some of the crucial tools they need to market Ergo, such as graphics, Ergo art, ergo logos, etc.
