Ergo has a strictly limited supply, an 8‐year emission schedule and a declining rate of emission over these 8 years. All tokens are mined through an original Asic and Pool‐resistant Proof‐of‐Work (“PoW”) algorithm called [Autolykos](https://ergonaut.space/en/Autolykos), which employs a [non-linear difficulty algorithm](https://www.docdroid.net/mcoitvK/ergopow-pdf#page=2). Therefore, there are 0 Ergs in existence at launch of mainnet as there was no ICO nor pre‐mine. At the end of 8 years, the final Erg supply will be 97,739,925 Ergs. The Ergo block interval is 2 minutes and for the first 2 years, each block will release a total of 75 Ergs to be shared between the miners and the Treasury (Treasury discussed below). But starting at year 2, the rate of emission will fall by 3.0 Ergs and thereafter further decline every 3 months by an additional 3.0 Ergs, which will result in an end to emission 8 years after launch. There will be no additional inflation and the Erg monetary base will remain fixed. The [emission schedule chart](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_05_20-curve/) illustrates this.

> Please don't mine direct to exchanges, and avoid pools who hold a significant % of the hashrate.

# Requirements
A 6GB GPU is the suggested minimum as Ergo heavily relies on memory usage while the core processor sits idle.

Search your card here [Autolykos v2 hashrates](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/autolykos-v2-hashrates/580) to find the hashrate. 


For the [AMD miner](https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_AMD_Miner), the compatible Operating Systems are
- RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.2 (64-bit version)
- RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.8 (64-bit version)
- Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit version)

Ergo can also be mined with [Nvidia miner](https://github.com/mhssamadani/Autolykos2_NV_Miner)
