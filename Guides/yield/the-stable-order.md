**In the dynamic world of decentralized finance (DeFi), innovative initiatives like The Stable Order are charting a novel path toward a more stable and equitable future. Central to this visionary enterprise is Gluon, a pioneering Contribution Accounting Token (CAT) that rewards individuals for their significant contributions to our collective mission of promoting worldwide stability.**

## The Essence of Gluon

Gluons are the cornerstone of The Stable Order, crafted to incentivize active engagement in our shared quests. Distinguished from traditional cryptocurrencies, Gluons are not mined or bought but are earned through valuable contributions to The Stable Order's projects. This ensures that every Gluon holder is not just an investor but a committed ally in our pursuit of a stable future.

For an in-depth exploration of Djed and The Stable Order's principles and initiatives, visit the [Djed documentation](https://docs.djed.one/about-us/the-stable-order).

### Do They Have Any Value?

The value of Gluon extends beyond conventional financial metrics, embodying the tangible contributions and commitments of its holders to the mission of The Stable Order. However, in practical terms, Gluons do possess intrinsic value, facilitated by a fixed exchange rate of 1 USD per Gluon. This rate supports peer-to-peer transactions within The Stable Order, enabling members to exchange Gluons for funds provided by benefactors for specific projects or initiatives.

This fixed rate ensures stability and fairness within the ecosystem, preventing speculative trading and maintaining the token's integrity as a measure of contribution rather than speculative asset. The system is designed to ensure that Gluons remain a reflection of genuine value added to the community and its objectives, thus supporting The Stable Order's mission of promoting stability and equity in the DeFi landscape.
