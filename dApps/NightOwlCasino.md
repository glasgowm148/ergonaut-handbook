 **Night Owl** 

- The world's first fully decentralized casino 🏛️ 

- Stablecoin-pegged bets 💵

- Profit-sharing ⚖️ 

- Full transparency 🔬 

- Open-source 👀

-----
Not only will you be able make (or lose) money on Night Owl by gambling (like with a traditional casino), you can also gain passive returns on a non-volatile asset, the OWL stable-token, by providing liquidity/being the house.

The unique option to be the house, no ICO or private token sales, plus fully-verifiable transparency, is why we like to call Night Owl- **"The World's Fairest Casino"**


Night Owl was part of Ergohack III and has lots of news to come in the near future.

### Third-Party Games on Night Owl

The Night Owl team actively provides support for third-party developers to build and list their games on the Night Owl platform. 


Night Owl's affiliate program, **The Long-eared Owl Program**, will help streamline the integration process for third-party games.

Developers can earn fees on Night Owl in a couple different ways: 

- **Traditional** | collect from liquidity provider earnings, when the "house" wins

- **Pay to Play** | take a set percent from every Pot

###### Third-party games can share liquidity

By using the OWL stable-token for their game currency, third-party developers can utilize already existing liquidity funds when launching their own games.**

Ultimately, this shared liquidity will lead to quicker ramp-up periods for third-party games on Night Owl. This is mutually beneficial players, liquidity providers, and game devs in the end.

##### Future of 3rd Party Games on Night Owl
