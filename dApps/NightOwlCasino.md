## dApp Overview 
Night Owl (in-progress) is the first decentralized casino on Ergo.
- USD-pegged bets
- liquidity pool for profit sharing
- full transparency on odds 
- fully open-source

Not only will you be able make (or lose) money on Night Owl by gambling (like with a traditional casino), you can also gain passive returns on a non-volatile asset, the OWL stable-token, by providing liquidity/being the house.

**This option to be the house, no ICO or private token sales, plus fully-verifiable transparency, is why we like to call Night Owl-** 

###### "The World's Fairest Casino"

Night Owl was part of Ergohack III and has lots of news to come in the near future.

## The Long-eared Owl Program 

### Third-Party Games on Night Owl

The Night Owl team actively provides support for third-party developers to build and list their games on the Night Owl platform. 

**The Long-eared Owl Program** 

Night Owl's affiliate program, **The Long-eared Owl Program**, will help streamline the integration process for third-party games.

Developers can earn fees on Night Owl in a couple different ways: 

**Traditional** | collect from liquidity provider earnings, when the "house" wins

**Pay to Play** | take a set percent from every Pot

###### Third-party games on Night Owl can share liquidity

By using the OWL stable-token for their game currency, third-party developers can utilize already existing liquidity funds when launching their own games.**

Ultimately, this shared liquidity will lead to quicker ramp-up periods for third-party games on Night Owl. This is mutually beneficial players, liquidity providers, and game devs in the end.
