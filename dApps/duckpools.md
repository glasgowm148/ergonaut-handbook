# Duckpools | Ergo Lending Protocol

Duckpools is a DeFi dApp on the Ergo blockchain. Ergo lending pools will allows users to lend ERG and its tokens to gain yield and borrow assets.

## A collateralized lending platform with algorithmic lending pools
**About duckpools:**

Duckpools is a lending platform being built on top of Ergo with features in development such as:

- Algorithmic Lending Pools - Provide ERG or native assets to lending pools and earn passive income on your capital.

- Collateralized Loans - Obtain funds secured by your collateral!

We believe duckpools can be the catalyst for an explosive DeFi ecosystem on Ergo as our platform facilitates increased utility of ERG and Ergo native assets and increases TVL in Ergo DeFi.
