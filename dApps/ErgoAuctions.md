## Artist Guidelines
### Auction House Best Practices

**Source: https://www.ergoforum.org/t/artist-guideline/2929**

- If you are an artist there are several things that you should take into consideration for using the Ergo Auction House.

- It is very important for each artist to have only one specific address that he works with. It means that every artist should have a wallet with only one address in it. This is important for several reasons:

- Will be important later for artist verification.
All your artworks will be identified with that address and you can easily present yourself on socials.
By design, you can use any wallet you like but currently, it is strongly advised to use Ergo Wallet Android 26 which is easy to use with the QR codes that auction house V2 provides. The next best option is using Yoroi Nightly 18 with the dapp connector 15 – Please note that this is still in testing and you may experience some minor issues.

- Make sure to configure the right wallet (with only one address in it) in the UI before issuing your artwork.

- Using only one wallet with the specified condition is specifically important for issuing artworks (and not starting auctions) to make sure you receive the royalties and your artwork is presentable under one address to prevent scams.

- Please note that there is no longer needed to use https://ergoutils.org/ 6 to issue artworks. You should do it on the AH website. First issue your artwork, once you see it under “Owned Artworks” then feel free to start your auction.

- If you decide to use Yoroi nighty:
Although many problems with Yoroi nighty are resolved, there are still some issues. If you encounter any problem with it, just open your wallet and let the transaction table update with your latest transactions, and then everything should be fine – also wait for pending transactions to be mined. If it is not resolved, send all your funds to yourself and wait for it to be mined.
