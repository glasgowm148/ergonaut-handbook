<p>There are sometimes occasions where you want to delete a token out of your wallet. Common reasons include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your address was airdropped a token you no longer want</li>
  <li>You created an NFT but something about it is not right. So, you want to delete one you created to remint it</li>
  <li>A project sent reserve, voting or other tokens that you no longer need</li>
</ul>
<p>To delete tokens on the Ergo website, you have two options.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://golfgl.de/ergopayshowcase/#burn-token">Ergopay Showcase, Burn Token</a>: This requires a Ergopay compatible wallet like <a href="https://ergoplatform.org/en/mobile-wallets/">Ergo Mobile Wallet</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://thierrym1212.github.io/tokenminter/burn.html">Ergo Token Burner</a>: Possible with a Ergo wallet extension, such as Nautilus</li>
</ol>
