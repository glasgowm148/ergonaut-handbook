# Ergo vs Kaspa

Ergo stands out as a superior choice for those seeking a cryptocurrency platform that is well-researched, built on known methods, and utilizes tried and tested principles. It is designed to provide an efficient, secure, and easy way to implement financial contracts, making it a robust platform for financial transactions. Ergo uses a unique consensus algorithm called Autolykos, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm designed to be ASIC-resistant. This makes it more decentralized and fairer than other PoW cryptocurrencies.

Ergo also features smart contract capabilities, with its own language called ErgoScript, which is a powerful and protocol-friendly scripting language for cryptocurrencies. This makes it possible to create complex financial contracts on the Ergo platform. Furthermore, Ergo emphasizes privacy, with features such as "ring signatures" and "zero-knowledge proofs" to ensure transactions can be private.

On the other hand, Kaspa, which uses the ghostDAG protocol, is still experimental and may not be the best place for robust financial contracts. As noted by kushti below, a core developer of Ergo, after examining Kaspa's core code, he expressed doubts about the introduction of smart contracts on the Kaspa platform due to its complex input signing with different sighash options taken from Bitcoin.

He also questioned the use of muhash for state authentication in Kaspa, and why an incremental hash was used instead of an authenticated dictionary. The presence of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Kaspa could lead to a verification dilemma, which might not have been adequately addressed in the ghostDAG paper and its continuations.

Kaspa is indeed a very different beast from the blockchains we know, and while it may have its merits, its experimental nature and the potential issues identified by kushti suggest that it may not be the most reliable platform for financial contracts. Ergo, with its well-researched and tested principles, offers a more solid and reliable platform for such purposes.

| Feature | Ergo (ERG) | Kaspa (KSP) |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Consensus Mechanism** | Autolykos (Proof-of-Work) | ghostDAG protocol |
| **Smart Contracts** | Yes, with [ErgoScript](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/scs/ergoscript/) | No |
| **Privacy Features** | Yes, includes ring signatures and zero-knowledge proofs | No |
| **Scalability** | Aims to solve [scalability with the power of eUTXO, NiPoPoWs and other novel features](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/protocol/scaling/) | Aims to solve scalability issues with ghostDAG protocol |
| **Use Cases** | Financial contracts | Fast transactions  |
| **ASIC-Resistant** | Yes | No, ASICs are on the network |

>
> Checked yesterday Kaspa core code a bit, I doubt introduction of smart contracts will be simple, on top of input signing with different sighash option taken from bitcoin they have
> 
> Also, have some doubts about muhash they are using for state authentication, and not clear why incremental hash was used instead of authenticated dictionary
>
> And verification dilemma in the presence of dag could hit hard, have to check how it was accounted in ghostdag paper and its continuations, probably just skipped
>
> Yonatan has an idea back in 2017 to have client side validation, so miners in this case can include double spends and other invalid but well formed transactions
>
> Which is solving verification dilemma for miners at least but a very different beast from blockchains we know
>
> But Kaspa is so extreme from initial investigation
