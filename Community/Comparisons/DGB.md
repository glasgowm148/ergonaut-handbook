# Digibyte


| Feature | Ergo (ERG) | DigiByte (DGB) |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Consensus Mechanism** | Autolykos (Proof-of-Work) | Multi-algorithm Proof-of-Work |
| **Smart Contracts** | Yes, with [ErgoScript](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/scs/ergoscript/) | Planned, with support for both decentralized apps (DApps) and centralized applications (DigiApps) |
| **Privacy Features** | Yes, includes ring signatures and zero-knowledge proofs | No |
| **Scalability** | Aims to solve [scalability with the power of eUTXO, NiPoPoWs and other novel features](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/protocol/scaling/) | Aims for high throughput with block generation speed of one block every 15-18 seconds |
| **Use Cases** | Financial contracts | Payment processing, digital assets, and more |
| **ASIC-Resistant** | Yes | Yes, due to multi-algorithm support |
| **Language-base** | JVM | TBC |
| **Public Distribution** | ~95% | TBC |
