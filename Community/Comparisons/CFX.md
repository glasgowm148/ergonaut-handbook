# Coinflux



> Conflux has a virtual machine that is similar to the EVM. However, there are still some considerable differences between Conflux and Ethereum. Conflux uses a different transaction format and a different rule for generating addresses from public keys. These differences often make it hard to port EVM compatible dApps to Conflux. Replacing CIP-72 and CIP-80, CIP-90 introduces a transaction execution environment called the Conflux eSpace. eSpace achieves full EVM compatibility without changing the existing accounts and transactions.
