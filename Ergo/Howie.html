<p>The Howie Test has four criteria that must all be met for an instrument to be considered a security: investment of money, common enterprise, reasonable expectation of profits, and entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.</p>
<p>Storage rent is part of the argument for the fourth prong. &nbsp;'entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others' which requires that the efforts of those outside the investor are essential to the success or failure of the enterprise.</p>
<ul>
  <li>While the Ergo Foundation (EF) undeniably plays a big role currently, the ERG ecosystem is becoming more decentralized and independent of the EF or any other centralized entity</li>
  <li>This decentralization will increase over time as more third-party developers bring value to the Ergo platform</li>
  <li>The Ergo platform is open source and permissionless, allowing anyone to build applications or launch tokens without the permission or assistance of the EF</li>
  <li>The EF and has went to great efforts to inform and encourage discussion with the community</li>
  <li>If the EF were to vanish, development would not need to stop, and miners could extract and spend all of the Foundation's funds through storage rent.<br><br>Therefore, it is difficult to argue that the success of the Ergo platform and the value of ERG tokens necessarily rely on the EF or its members. Overall, the value of ERG tokens is becoming more market-driven and independent of the EF, which suggests that the fourth criterion of the Howey Test is not met.</li>
