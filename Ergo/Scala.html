<p>kushti started implementation of Ergo in Scala, which was an attractive language for developers like morphic and greenhat. Objectively, Scala has some features that give it advantages over other JVM languages:</p>
<p>1) Scala is cross platform. The same code can run on JVM, JS and natively.</p>
<p>2) Scala is growing in popularity as a development platform.</p>
<p>3) Beyond language, Ergo also has support for key ecosystem libraries for all platforms.</p>
<p>4) Scala's code is more concise syntactically and allows for more conceptually abstract code.</p>
<p>5) Scala can also be more efficient than similar Java code. Java generics like ArrayList&lt;T&gt; can only be used when T is reference type, i.e. allocated (or boxed) object. In Scala T can be primitive unboxed time such as Byte or Int and also Scala compiler can do code specialization so that T values are never boxed. This can be 2x difference in performance.</p>
<p>6) Finally, Scala is also multi-paradigm (OOP + FP + LP) so you can combine advantages of the paradigms depending on the domain.</p>
<p>All this is true with Scala2. With Scala3, there are additional metaprogramming features and more tools for zero-cost abstractions.</p>
