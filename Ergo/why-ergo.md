# Why Ergo

Ergo is focused on being a decentralized, open, permissionless, secure platform for contractual money that can be used by ordinary people. Development on Ergo is research driven with a scrupulous attention to security and the assumptions underpinning it. 

## Scalable

Ergo is scalable. It is compatible with established methods of scaling, including Sharding, Hydra, BitcoinNG-style macroblocks, the Lightening Network, Rainbow Network, and others.

## Adaptable

Ergo is adaptable. Many of the parameters of Ergo can be changed with a consensus of greater than 90% by miners. 

## Innovative

Ergo is innovative. It had the first formally verified smart contracts. It uses NiPoPows, which allow for security guarantees of a full node on a light client. Smart contracts on Ergo can be debugged using standard Scala debugging tools. Tokens are first class citizens and are minted at the protocol level. Ergo has a true decentralized cross-chain DEX (Spectrum). A variety of P2P self-sovereign decentralized applications have been built on Ergo. They include: Ergo Auctions, SigmaFi, and others. Ergo deployed the first implementation of the SigmaUSD/Djed stablecoin. Ergo has decentralized grid trading. There are also many of the dApps available on other chains: DAOs (Paideia), NFT marketplaces (SkyHarbor) and others.

## Unique

Some of Ergo's innovations are unique: storage rent (on-chain garbage collection), Rosen Bridge (smart contract implementation that can bridge any chain with a multi-signature wallet) cryptographic protocols as applications (e.g. stealth addresses, the Ergo mixer, etc.), oracle pools, stablecoin designs (Dexy), financial instruments (ChainCash) and more.

## Values Driven

Perhaps most importantly, Ergo was far launched. Most contracts are dApps are open-source and can be re-used. To read more on the values of the Ergo Blockchain, read the [Ergo Manifesto](/en/Ergo/manifesto).
