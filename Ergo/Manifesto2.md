# Ergo Manifesto 2.0
## Help Contibute to the *unofficial* Ergo Manifesto 2.0 !

The Ergo Manifesto is considered essesntial reading for all prospective Ergonauts, serving as a "Prime Directive" *of sorts* for the Ergo project/network. As great as the Manifesto is, many believe it is not without its faults, and therefore could use some *light* editing in various places. 

The intent of this page will be to maintain a community-edited version of the Manifesto- or a Ergo Manifesto 2.0- that we can all work on and contribute to as a community. One major point worth noting, although the Ergo Manifesto is in need of some light editing, the text is not to be changed in tone or implied intent. 

**The Ergo Manifesto 2.0 must adhere to the original message, and making as few changes as possible to the original text is the overall goal of this particular version.**

The Ergo Manifesto hopes to educate and offer a vision of what blockchain technology can achieve. We hope to build society through horizontal cooperation through production under the division of labor, trade and exchange, and solidarity and mutual aid.

We believe this is achievable while maintaining basic principles that benefit the well-being of all humans. Core principles that have been central to human rights and values must be maintained as our technological capacities evolve. The built tools must enrich human value rather than subjugate humans in surveillance and control systems. 

A lot of blockchain-related news these days is saying that a bank X or a corporation Y will use a "blockchain" to "reduce costs". 

Big banksters consider this just another buzzword as another tool to extract value from everywhere more efficiently and save on cutting job positions.

What I witnessed in the early years around online forums users is this,

Cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich ordinary people. Small businesses struggling to make ends meet, not big depersonalized financial capital.

This is what inspired me. This is my dream.

In the eyes of the original broad community vision, the tools of a cryptocurrency should allow people to do economic activity whatever the business size, geographic location, or interest rates set by big players.

The tools should allow people to make contracts (digital, self-enforcing, reasonable smart contracts) regardless of the differences in jurisdictions, traditions, followed business practices, etc. I hope Ergo will be helpful here.

Thousands of small cooperatives and individual entrepreneurs are much more critical to healthy and sustainable wealth growth around the globe compared to a couple of corporations hiding profits in offshore havens.

Let's consider the use and integration with communities, cooperative federations, nonprofit foundations, and philanthropic trusts. 

Let's try to create grassroots finance. 

Yes, many other things can be built, but this goal should not be forgotten. Smart contracts that help create value and protect the common people.

Bitcoin Origins
The first Bitcoin block (known as the Genesis block) contained a message stating, "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."

The creator of Bitcoin and inventor of the first working blockchain chose to conceal his identity through a pseudonym that we've all grown accustomed to, Satoshi Nakamoto.

This block timestamped both the inception of Bitcoin and the start of an era of technological and financial innovation. Simply put, this was the catalyst for a full-blown revolution.

Decentralization is political, giving birth to the idea that technology could replace monopolized powers. Systems could be put in place to transfer value globally without the need for intermediaries or oversight. 

People could choose the currency they use and determine who, how and when they could exchange value with one another. 

An entire industry formed around the idea of P2P commerce. Open, borderless and secure channels could potentially prove mechanisms to level the economic playing field and provide tools for prosperity for the average citizen of earth. 

Current Market Mindset
The mentality of crypto markets shifted considerably after the ICO mania of 2017. It seems that the space as a whole has come to celebrate bailouts, printing, and stimulus.

Yes, there have been some massive price gains in fiat and much hype-based marketing. Still, it seems the original intent of the goals of cypherpunks is becoming increasingly diluted. 

This is something that needs to be addressed. If cryptocurrency is to be implemented as an effective tool for the average human, we need tooling and adoption. Right now, the market mentality seems as follows: how do we honeypot new users with hype marketing, drive pumps and cannibalize these new members of communities.

The current state of the market is a little sad. We need to get back to the roots of the crypto-revolution, decentralized tools that are private and secure and drive real-world adoption of these systems. The ideal is to create tools that help people create value. 

Why is this important?
The global economy has not improved since the original bailouts. I understand that the central narrative around privacy and security always plays on emotional extremes; however, the reality is it is always the ordinary humans that get burned when economies implode. 

Think about it for a second. 

Corporations have access to foreign markets and foreign credit. They have many tools to adjust and circumvent economic difficulties. 

As for criminal enterprises, they generally benefit from economic hardship, and hard times drive self-medication. Larger criminal syndicates are essentially import/export businesses. They also have access to foreign currency, often run black-market currency exchanges, and further leverage this international access for profit. 

Terrorist organizations benefit during times of economic hardship. Nothing motivates a person towards violence like righteous anger from feeling trapped and hopeless. Terrorist organizations thrive in regions of chaos, and they feed on turmoil; it is their single greatest recruitment tool. 

The wealthy in our world often have internationally allocated portfolios. They are relatively liquid and can circumvent difficulties through market access, regulatory means such as tax havens, loopholes, and jurisdictional arbitrage.

There are multiple examples of economies that are in severe distress, one that made news recently was Turkey. The Turkish Central Banks recently banned cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, and they cut access to a potential tool that would benefit the average citizen. 

The foreign exchange rate of the Lira to the dollar in 2010 was 1.14, and the current exchange rate is 8.50. That is an 86.5882% decrease in purchasing power.

Imagine you are a Turk; perhaps you have traded a lifetime of time and labor to earn and save. In the span of a little over a decade, over 86% of your monetary value has disappeared. 

The sad thing is that blockchain was accessible in Turkey; however, the custodial actors abused their position. 

It is critically important to make systems as non-interactive and non-custodial as possible. Eliminating the potential for bad actors and protecting the people. This was a failure in technology and should serve as a warning of the dangers of centralized blockchain.

Let this serve not as an example of why blockchain is terrible. Why ordinary people need truly decentralized tools, they can trust. 

Like in most jurisdictions on earth, the average citizen of every country has essentially zero power over monetary policy. The average citizen lacks the tools that corporations, criminal organizations, terrorist organizations, and the wealthy have to protect themselves and benefit from financial difficulties. Financial circumstances were created by the same powers that now hold their wealth hostage. 

In reality, people at the top always get the life raft when the boat sinks, while those at the bottom go down with the ship. Now, this is not unique to Turkey. This is currently a global phenomenon. It is apparent looking at the changes in the distribution of wealth. However, it has been sanitized to seem more palatable. It is not the wealthy who have life rafts, and the ordinary people are drowning. 

It is a K Shaped economic recovery.  

The Weaponization of Money
Centralized programmable digital money sounds like an efficient technical upgrade to the existing monetary infrastructure. In some areas, this may be the case. However, it appears that the basic constructs of money are in the beginning stages of an era that will further weaponize money against the average human. Current fiat-based monetary systems attack ordinary citizens by creating persistent inflationary pressures. 

This is the direct result of central bank printing, monetary intervention, and mismanagement of fiscal budgets by central governments.

The resulting monetary policy has inflicted great hardship on the average global citizen by perpetually driving up the cost of living. Hyper Monetization has transformed nearly every asset class into a financial instrument that is used as a means to generate
