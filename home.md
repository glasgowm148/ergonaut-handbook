# Welcome to ergonaut.space
ergonaut.space is the community wiki of the Ergo blockchain which showcases the possibilities and details of Ergo for non-technical people. If you are a developer or advanced user of cryptocurrencies, [docs.ergoplatform](http://docs.ergoplatform.org/) on GitHub may be a more appropriate source of information.

## What is Ergo?
Ergo is the next generation of blockchain and brings unstoppable smart money designed to be used by ordinary people. 

## What can I do with Ergo?
The [Sigmaverse](https://sigmaverse.io/) provides a list of all the decentralized applications ([dApps](https://ergonaut.space/en/Glossary/dApps)) available on the Ergo blockchain. Common uses include:

- Exchanging one cryptocurrency for another on a decentralized exchange (DEX)
- Earning money by transferring your cryptocurrency into a liquidity pool, staking it in a dApp or joining a mining pool. (See [Yield](/en/Guides/yield))
- Transfering your cryptocurrencies to a private wallet address
- Buying digital art in an auction site
- Create or support a raffle for a charitable cause
- Creating Ergo payment links for goods and services you provide
- Tip ERG or native ERG tokens across socials. 
- Secure profits using SigmaUSD. 
- Check out some on-chain metrics on [ergo.watch](https://ergo.watch/metrics)

The Ergo ecosystem is under continuous development. Expect new ways to use it to emerge it in the future.
