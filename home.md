# Welcome to ergonaut.space
ergonaut.space is the community wiki of the Ergo blockchain, a guide translating how to use and the underlying technical details of the Ergo blockchain into easy to understand language for non-technical people. If you are a developer or advanced user of cryptocurrencies, the [Ergo Wiki](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki) on GitHub may be a more appropriate source of information.

## What is Ergo?
Ergo is programmable money designed to be used by ordinary people. 

## What can I do with Ergo?
The [Sigmaverse](https://sigmaverse.io/) provides a list of all the decentralized applications ([dApps](https://ergonaut.space/en/Glossary/dApps)) available on the Ergo blockchain. Common uses include:

- Exchanging one cryptocurrency for another on a decentralized exchange (DEX)
- Earning money by transferring your cryptocurrency into a liquidity pool, staking it in a dApp or joining a mining pool. (See [Yield](/en/Guides/yield))
- Transfering your cryptocurrencies to a private wallet address
- Buying digital art in an auction site
- Creating a raffle for a charitable cause
- Creating Ergo payment links for goods and services you provide

The Ergo ecosystem is under continuous development. Expect new ways to use it to emerge it in the future.
