# Welcome to ergonaut.space
ergonaut.space is the community wiki of the Ergo blockchain, which showcases the possibilities and details of Ergo for non-technical people. If you are a developer or advanced user of cryptocurrencies, [ErgoDocs](http://docs.ergoplatform.org/) on GitHub may be a more appropriate source of information.
